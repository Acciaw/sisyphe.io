Sisyphe.io is a **final-year NSI (Digital and Computer Science) project**, winner of the 2024 NSI Trophies at the academic level, created and successfully developed by Killian MILANI, Siméon GILLET, Kylian ROUSSEAU, and Arthur BARBEROUSSE.

A complete **version-by-version changelog** of the project up to the release is available in the "source" directory: [changelog.txt](source/changelog.txt).

> 📝
> Following the conclusion of the 2024 NSI Trophies, the project documentation was updated to clarify the real involvement of each team member. You may notice differences between the documentation on [the competition website](https://trophees-nsi.fr/resultats-2024) and that on this GitHub repository.

## Summary

The game immerses you in a parallel Greek mythology, where the punishment imposed by the gods on Sisyphus is to wander an infinite labyrinth, searching for rocks to push into holes scattered across the terrain. The gameplay is inspired by the *Sokoban* concept but introduces numerous **original mechanics**, which you can explore across **5 unique worlds**! The game also includes a complete and user-friendly **level editor**!

## Prerequisites, Installation, Deployment

> 📝
> The project has a **dedicated website** that you can visit at https://sisyphe.acciaw.me/ from your computer or smartphone. The website’s source code is also included in the project repository.

> 💡
> If you prefer not to install the entire project, you can simply download the executable version from the [dedicated website](https://sisyphe.acciaw.me) or by clicking [here](https://sisyphe.acciaw.me/windows).

> 🛑
> Before proceeding with the installation, make sure your machine runs Windows 10 or 11.

### Setup Steps

1. Install the Thonny software on your machine:
   - Click [here](https://thonny.org/) to visit the official download site.
2. Once installed, download the project’s source code from the [official website](https://sisyphe.acciaw.me) or the GitHub repository.
   - Make sure to extract the game files into an easily accessible folder on your machine.
3. Open the "source" directory and double-click the file "sisyphe.io_beta_v1.0.py" or use the context menu: "Right-Click -> Open with -> Thonny."
4. In Thonny, install the dependencies by navigating to the menu Tools -> Manage Packages...:

![Dependencies 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28db7150-1531-4058-acbc-963e62f76edd)

6. Ensure the variable "fichier_exe" on line 25 of the Python file is set to "False."
7. Click the green "Run Current Script" button or press F5 to start the project.
8. If the project fails to run due to a missing key error, open and execute the Python file "del_save.py" located in the project’s "assets" directory using Thonny.

> 🛑
> If you choose to use the executable version of the game, it may not run on older versions of Windows 10. To resolve this, go to the menu "Right-Click -> Properties -> Compatibility" and let Windows fix the compatibility issues for you.
> Additionally, if the game editor doesn’t run in the executable version, try creating an exception for the program in your antivirus settings.

## Usage Protocol

The game launches with the main menu window, where two buttons, "Open" and "Editor," are initially grayed out.  
-> A file named "Sisyphe.io" is created in your "appdata/local" directory, containing a "settings.json" file that saves your progress and preferences.
After adjusting the settings to your liking, click the "Play" button and complete all levels in World 1 to unlock the editing functions and familiarize yourself with the game.

**In-game Controls:**

![Gameplay GIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c22ac271-f9df-46ec-990e-e7f9a136cd7b)

- Use your movement keys to navigate the game grid: "Up," "Right," "Down," and "Left" (default: Arrow keys).
- Press your "Replay" key to restart a level in case of an error (default: R).
- Use your "Menu" key to return to the main menu (default: M).

To progress, position yourself behind a rock and push it into a black hole, as shown in the video above.  
The game will introduce increasingly complex mechanics, with tutorials provided at the start of each world.
